# RADDBIA 

> A Reference Architecture for Decentralized and Distributed Business Intelligence And Analytics Architectures

## Introduction

This is a specification of a reference architecture that should support  people to build reasoned architectures for business intelligence and anlytics architectures in decentralized and distributed use cases. Therefore, it provides a systematic to analyse your use case and derive adequate components, roles and processes. This document should help you to learn more about the various components, their relations and how RADDBIA can help in specific scenarios.

## Who is this for?

This specification is the result of a on-going research project. It can be used by anybody that is interested in building analytics architectures that go beyond classical data warehouse patterns. It focueses decentralized and distributed scenarios, but also holds insight that can be adopted in other use cases.

## About and contributing

This is a work in progress and the document will evolve over time. Feel free to contribute your opinions and ideas via git issues.
